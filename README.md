# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition system to classify 60000 images from MNIST dataset. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed for MNIST dataset on LeNet-5 architecture. Existing CNN was improvised by implementing Subspace Approximation with Augmented Kernels (SAAK) transform. 

The python file MLP_function.py that has my own code for a Multi-layer perceptron neural network which takes in network paramteres like number of hidden layers, neurons in each layer, activation function, weight initialization and regularization parameter implemented using NumPy on Python.
